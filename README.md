Project one - static front end website

This is a website I made, that will act as a portfolio of my work as the number of projects I work on increase, i'm hoping that it will act as a good reference point for employers to make an accurate estimate of my ability. it also includes a small section about me and a contact form in case they want to get in touch.

## User Experience

### The Strategy
I wanted a page where recruiters/employers could visit and before long have a good feel of who I am as a person without all the clutter of a regular CV

### The Scope
The idea was to give the visitors all the information they could need, without bombarding them, they could get to know me, look at the skills and abilities and contact me if they're interested in my work.

### The Structure

I wanted the page to flow in a way that everything you saw made sense in that order, I wanted to have my name and portrait first, so they can associate after that follows that to me, then the skills and experience that I have so far, so they can understand the sort of work i've done, then moving on toi the about me so they can put a personality to the person they saw earlier and then finally an embedded google maps link so they can see where i'm based and where i would most likley be working the majority of the time.
