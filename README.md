Project one - static front end website

This is a website I made, that will act as a portfolio of my work as the number of projects I work on increase, I'm hoping that it will act as a good reference point for employers to make an accurate estimate of my ability. it also includes a small section about me and a contact form in case they want to get in touch.

It aims to showcase myself and the work I have done so that employers/recruiters can quickly gather what information they need without any back and forth between myself and the user.

The Value that I will get out of this website is:

- Build my personal brand
- Have a platform that is fluid and can be updated alongside my progress
- It'll make getting in contact a simple process

The Value that visitors will get from this site are:

- An insight in to who I am as a person
- A simple way to contact me
- A list of projects and collaborations that will be constantly updated

## User Experience

### The Strategy
I wanted a page where recruiters/employers could visit and before long have a good feel of who I am as a person without all the clutter of a regular CV

### The Scope
The idea was to give the visitors all the information they could need, without bombarding them, they could get to know me, look at the skills and abilities and contact me if they're interested in my work.

### The Structure

I wanted the page to flow in a way that everything you saw made sense in that order, I wanted to have my name and portrait first, so they can associate after that follows that to me, then the skills and experience that I have so far, so they can understand the sort of work I've done, then moving on to the about me so they can put a personality to the person they saw earlier and then finally an embedded google maps link so they can see where I'm based and where I would most likely be working the majority of the time.

### The Surface

I opted to keep all of the content simple Grey/White to provide a contrast and make it easy to read, to complement this my background image features a small pop of colour as to avoid making the page appear bland.
## Features

- Both pages feature a fixed footer that responds to screen size and allows for easy access to different social links. 
- At the top of the page there is a Nav bar to easily navigate to/from the contact me page, as well as jump to different points on the page if you're looking for something specific.
- An embedded Google maps Iframe placed at the bottom of the page, this is to help potential employers or recruiters understand more about me in a more interactive way without flat out telling people where I live 
- A "Contact Me" form on a second page to allow people that are potentially interested in my work to easily get in contact, the form requires; Name, Email Address and a brief message, without all of those the form will alert the use that the unfilled field is required.

## Features I'd Like to Implement

- I would eventually like to add an interactive table with some of the projects that I've worked where the links to the Github repository is linked, this would allow the user to get a first hand look at what I've been a created or collarborated on.
- The choice to have my CV donwloadable directly from a link on the site, to shorten the time between interactions, rather than users having to message me potentially asking for it, they can get it directly themselves via the site.
## Tech

**HTML:** Used to input all of the content on index.html and contact.html.

**CSS:** Used to style all of the content, and to adjust responsiveness on different screen sizes.

**Google Fonts:** Supplied the fonts for the header and body.

**Unsplash:** For the background image used.

**Font Awesome:** Used for the social media icons in the footer.

**Google Maps:** Used Maps to get my location and add it into an Iframe.




## Testing

The website does achieve the intended goal of showcasing my skills and experiences whilst at the same time telling them about my personality, all made purposefully to be efficient and easy to read. Additionally it has the added functionality to get in contact with me if needed.

If the user finds they want to know more about me all the social media links work as intended and open in a new tab for ease of access. Furthermore the contact form makes use of the "Required" attribute, so that the user need to fill in all the information specified.

The site was tested on Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari to ensure the desired outcome no matter where it is being viewed from, I also adjusted the site to remain readable on different screen sizes (going from my 5120px wide screen, to regular full HD screens, to tablets and finally to phones with the Iphone 5 being the lowest size I made adjustments for)
